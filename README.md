kodi-cli
========

Kodi/XBMC bash script to send Kodi commands using JSON RPC. It also allows sending YouTube videos to Kodi.

## Usage

`kodi-cli -[p|i|s|(y|q) youtube URL/ID|t "text to send"|o "youtube title"]`

## Setup

You must either put your Kodi setup (found under "Interfaces") in the first few lines of the script itself, or put a file named .kodirc in your $HOME directory. This file (example provided) contains only four lines in *this specific order*:

```
The Kodi Host
The port Kodi listens on (the webserver port)
Username
Password
```

 -k Skip backward in the current played video     
 -y play YouTube video. Use either URL/ID (of video)
 -q queue YouTube video to the current list. Use either URL/ID (of video). Use instead of -y.
 -o play YouTube video directly on Kodi. Use the name of video.

    Context menu and information

```

You can create a dialog to download and sequentially (and with confirmation) play entire playlists - defaulting to your Watch Later playlist - on your Kodi, acting like a kind of remote "casting" program.  See the script **playlist_to_kodi** for an example.
